**Notefy Application**

**Project Description**
Hi, Kory here! üëã

This is my final project. For this project, I opted for a simple yet functional and useful idea, which incorporates all that I have learned from the beginning of the bootcamp. 

The **Notefy Application** is a web-based app designed to create, edit, or delete personal notes. The app works seamlessly across mobile and desktop devices. It uses an API to fetch notes stored in a MongoDB database I set up. The database can be accessed securely with credentials and is publicly accessible via the `0.0.0.0/0` pathway. I aimed for simplicity and functionality in both the design and implementation.

Thank you for stopping by! üòä

Cheers! üëç
