Hi, Kory here

This is my final project. For this project i opted to go for a simple yet functional and useful idea,
which incorporates all that i learnt from the beginning of the bootcamp. 

The Notefy Application is an app to create, edit or delete your own notes which can be accessed on mobile and desktop.
the app will be using an API to fetch the notes from a mongo database that I set up. The databases can be accessed by 
credentials and also from anywhere with the 0.0.0.0/0 public pathway. I was aiming for simplicity and functionality as well

Some future fetures i would like to add would be "sign-up/sign-in" option so that a user can be created and their profile 
preferences saved. I will do that through firebase authentiacation. I also wanted to add a spotify sign-in button so users
can listen in on their own playlists but unfortunately ran into problems getting my Spotify API Key but its a working progress

Thank you for stoping by

Cheers!üëç
